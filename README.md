# Toolbox Plus
**Toolbox Plus** allows you to customize the mode (icons and text/icons/text), icon size (small/large), flexibility (modifies the toolbar buttons to occupy the entire toolbar), and text position (below icon or beside icon) of each individual toolbar, similar to SeaMonkey's toolbar functionality.

## Building
